Init README for Final Project

I wil still use javia...

---
For this project:
- I choose, Gradle, Java 8, Visual Studio Code, And SpringBoot
	- Reasons:
		1. Gradle for the wrapper easy deployment on TA's testing environment
		2. Java 8 for the standard OOP style, and my familiarity
		3. VSC for the light weight, and less IDE magics
		4. SpringBoot for the light weight, and Tomcat inclution

- To run the program:
	- ```$ ./gradlew build```
	- ```$ ./gradlew run```
	- The app will be running at ```localhost:8080```
	- To get hello world use ```localhost:8080/hello-world```
